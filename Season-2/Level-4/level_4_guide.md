## Level 4 ‚Äì XSS Protection: Escaping & Safe Rendering in Flask/Jinja2

---

## 1. Understanding the Problem

### Context

This level simulates a web form vulnerability where user input is used to render HTML without proper sanitization or escaping.

A Flask app renders planet info based on a user-submitted form. The response HTML includes user input directly, and the rendering uses `{{ planet | safe }}`, which disables automatic escaping.

### Issue

```text
Although the app filters certain characters with regex (`[<>{}[\]]`), it's still vulnerable to **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**.

| Component       | Flaw                                                         |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Input Filtering | Regex sanitization is too simplistic                        |
| Templating      | Uses `| safe`, disabling Jinja2's built-in auto-escaping    |
| Output Handling | Raw user input rendered in the DOM with JavaScript injection |

---
```

## 2. Key Concepts: Preventing XSS

### A. Autoescaping with Jinja2

‚úÖ Safe by default:

```html
<p>{{ user_input }}</p>
```

‚ùå Unsafe when `| safe` is used:

```html
<p>{{ user_input | safe }}</p> <!-- Disables escaping -->
```

---

### B. Input vs. Output Context

Escaping should happen when displaying user input, not just when collecting it.

```python
# ‚ùå Doesn't prevent HTML injection
re.sub(r'[<>{}[\]]', '', input)

# ‚úÖ Escapes for HTML context
from markupsafe import escape
safe_input = escape(user_input)
```

## 3. Fixing the Vulnerable Code

```text
| Vulnerability    | Secure Fix                                      |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Regex sanitizing | Use `markupsafe.escape()` instead               |
| `| safe` in HTML | Remove the `| safe` and enable Jinja2 escaping |
| Injection risk   | Validate input early and fail gracefully        |

---
```

## 4. Test Coverage

### `tests.py`

* Submits valid and invalid planets
* Confirms sanitized output
* Includes a test for active content (`<script ...>`) being **blocked**

### `hack.txt`

* Simulates real XSS attack:

```html
<img src="x" onerror="alert(1)">
```

* Should be displayed as text, not executed as a script

## 5. Training Your Brain

```text
| Area            | Ask Yourself                                                |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rendering       | Is user input rendered in the HTML output?                  |
| Escaping        | Are we disabling built-in safety mechanisms (`| safe`)?     |
| Filtering       | Are we relying too much on regex instead of context-aware escaping? |
| Output Context  | Where is this string going? Into HTML, JS, or a URL?        |
